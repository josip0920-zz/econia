Welcome to the developer documentation site for Econia, a hyper-parallelized on-chain CLOB for the Aptos blockchain

## What is Econia?

Econia is a protocol that lets anyone in the world trade a digital asset with anyone else in the world, at whatever price they want.
More specifically, Econia is a central limit order book (CLOB), a fundamental financial tool utilized by financial institutions like stock markets, except unlike the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, Econia is open-source and decentralized.

## Econia is in development

Econia is currently under development, and this is the first iteration that has shipped to the [Aptos](https://aptos.dev) blockchain.
This version 1 minimum viable prototype (v1 MVP) introduces a key innovation for on-chain trading, Econia's atomic matching engine, which settles trades with finality during the transaction in which they were placed.
That's right, Econia's v1 MVP implements the world's first on-chain atomic matching engine, and all builders are welcome to try it out for themselves!

If you are a builder and you are interested in working with Econia, first take a look at the [design overview](https://econia.dev/design-overview), as this provides a technical breakdown that will provide some context for the system design.
Then try [using Econia](using.md), and let's see what we can build together!

## Devnet account

As of 2022-07-17, Econia is initialized on the Aptos devnet at account [0xf538533414430323ccd2d8f8d7ce33819653cac5a7634a80cd2429ab904b6659](https://aptos-explorer.netlify.app/account/0xf538533414430323ccd2d8f8d7ce33819653cac5a7634a80cd2429ab904b6659)
