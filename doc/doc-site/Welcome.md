*Hyper-parallelized on-chain order book for the Aptos blockchain*

Thank you for your interest in the Econia Ecosystem!
Econia is a hyper-parallelized order book protocol that runs on the Aptos blockchain.
Engineered for web-scale performance and built to provide equal global access to markets.
Econia leverages the optimistic concurrency of Aptos’ Block-STM execution engine, scaling up on-chain trading both across and within trading pairs.

We are grateful to be building the future of DeFi with you.
